### This is a test post. It will be about Lego Ninjago, a TV show Karen and her mom like to watch. A lot. As in **3-4 episodes per day.**

Karen's favourite ninja is Zane. Here is a picture:

P.S. Karen is ~~not~~ afraid of this TV show. She thinks it's ~~not~~ scary and she does ~~not~~ hide during the scary parts.

When asked to describe the show, Karen said "It's good. I really really like it."
