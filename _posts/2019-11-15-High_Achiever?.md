## How can you tell if a child is gifted or high-achieving (or both)? Here are the differences between the two.
##### Contrary to popular belief, not all bright children can be labelled as gifted and not all gifted students are high achievers. Here's how to tell them apart.

Gifted | High Achiever
------------ | -------------
Asks a lot of questions | Knows a lot of answers
Motivatied by internal forces (curiosity) | Motivated by external forces (grades, praise)
May not get good grades in school | Gets good grades in school
